				<h2><u> HTML </u></h2>
				<p align="justify"> HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language that is used to create the basic structure of the webpage, to form the skeleton of the webpage. It is not a programming language it is a markup language that is used to give structure to the text document and uses tags to define an element in a document. Browser does not display the tags of HTML but display the content that are written within the tags. HTML relies on other technologies such as CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript as the tools to make websites look really colorful attractive and responsive. </p>
				<p><i> The basic structure of HTML is given below: </i></p><br>

				<h2><u> CSS </u></h2>
				<p align="justify"> CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet that is used to describe and change the style of the HTML document. It helps to describe how the html document should be displayed. CSS define for the style of a particular HTML document or element once can be used over and over on any of the web pages. CSS style rule consists of two parts that are selector and deceleration where selector can be a html tag and deceleration is the format (width, height, color, font, etc.) that u want for the elements and documents present inside that tag.  </p>
				<p><i> There are three types of CSS </i></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Internal CSS</li>
					<li>External CSS</li>
					<li>Inline CSS</li>
				</ul><br>
				<h2><u> JavaScript </u></h2>
				<p align="justify"> JavaScript is a light weight programming language that is used in HTML to make webpage look interactive and also to insert dynamic text into the HTML that ususally react to events. JavaScript is not related to Java other than by name and by some syntactic similarities. It is interpreted language. JavaScript code runs in the browser and is case sensitive and can change the content of HTML elements and CSS properties easily.  </p><br>
				<h1><strong><i>Research Report</i></strong></h1><hr size="3">
				<p align="justify"> A lot of research was done on how to create an attractive website and webpages using HTML, CSS and JavaScript in order to create the website and webpages. When i was going through youtube searching how to create a website using HTML and CSS i came across a web developer. I watched the video and liked his idea and concept on how to create an attractive website. I searched his website too, it's link was given below the video and learned a lot from it too. I created my website taking reference from it. i learned how to create button and to hover text from his website and applied to my own differently( different size, font and placing) i also learned how to float text in the screen from his website. In addition i used hr tags to make linings and use a tag to link the added buttons on the website. </p>
