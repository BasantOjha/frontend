      <h2>SmartPhones and Laptops</h2><hr>
        <p> We are very lucky that we are able to use the technologies of nowdays. SmartPhones and Laptops are one of the most 
          advanced devices of todays era that are mostly used for communication and other purposes. We are now able to 
          communicate with our friends and relatives very quickly in the time of need. We don't feel ourself alone since we 
          can just connect with our friends  through text, voice call or social media. We can capture the videos and images 
          that we think that we have to see in the future. If we dont know the way to our destination then GPS technology 
          helps us to pinpoint to ourselves. we can do online jobs and participate in different live events.
